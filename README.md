Constitution
============

*A web framework written in C*

Why?
----

Because:
 * Fast as blazes.
 * Minimalistic.
 * Fine grained control over memory management.
 * Bindings for **all** the things!
 * Why not?

Status
------

This project currently only has this README file. Keep an eye out for the codebase expanding, and please report any issues (potential or real) that you spot.

Thanks!
